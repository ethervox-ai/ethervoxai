## 🔐 Privacy & Security

EthervoxAI is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **🏠 Local Processing**: All voice and AI processing happens on-device by default
- **🔒 Encrypted Communication**: Any optional cloud communications are end-to-end encrypted  
- **👤 Data Control**: Users have complete control over data retention and deletion
- **📋 Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all system interactions with privacy dashboard
- **✅ Consent Management**: Granular consent controls for cloud services and data sharing
- **🌍 Cross-Platform Privacy**: Consistent privacy controls across all implementation languages
- **🔍 No Telemetry**: No automatic data collection or telemetry by default
- **⚡ Offline Capable**: Full functionality without internet connection

### Privacy Dashboard Features

- Real-time privacy status monitoring
- Data retention policy management  
- Cloud service consent controls
- Audit log viewer and export
- Model download and caching controls
- Cross-language implementation privacy sync

### Privacy Modes & Language Support

**Privacy Modes:**
- **Strict**: All processing happens locally, user consent required for any cloud access
- **Balanced**: Local processing with optional cloud fallback for complex queries  
- **Permissive**: Allows cloud processing for enhanced capabilities

**Supported Languages (MVP):**
- English (US/UK)
- Spanish (Latin America)
- Mandarin (Simplified Chinese)

**Multi-Platform Implementations:**
- **TypeScript/Node.js**: Full-featured reference implementation
