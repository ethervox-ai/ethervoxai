## 🎯 MVP Vision

Enable seamless, ambient, multilingual voice interaction across smart devicesâ€”while preserving user privacy, 
maintaining local-first execution, and empowering end users with full control over their data.

---

## 🧭 Core Principles

- **Local-First Execution**: All speech processing, intent detection, and language modeling performed on-device.
- **Multilingual Seamlessness**: Auto-switch spoken and response language based on user input; no manual toggling
required.
- **Ambient Interaction**: No wake words required.
Devices operate seamlessly in context, optionally personalized with local names.
- **User Data Sovereignty**: Transparent local UI + dashboard showing data flows, history,
and user-approved cloud queries.
- **Extensibility**: Modular SDK and plugin system for LLM routing and hardware integrations.

## ðŸ“ Notes & Assumptions

- Cloud access only via opt-in and only for web/RAG queries
- MVP includes sandbox examples for kitchen appliance and robot use cases
- All data is processed locally unless explicitly triggered by user query
