## 🚀 Security Best Practices for Contributors

### 👨‍💻 **For Developers**

#### 🔒 **Secure Coding**
```markdown
✅ **DO:**
- Use parameterized queries for database access
- Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs
- Implement proper error handling
- Use secure random number generation
- Follow principle of least privilege

❌ **DON'T:**
- Hard-code secrets or credentials
- Use deprecated or insecure libraries
- Ignore compiler/linter security warnings
- Implement custom cryptography
- Store sensitive data in logs
```

#### 🔐 **Data Protection**
```markdown
✅ **DO:**
- Use local storage by default
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement secure data deletion
- Follow data minimization principles
- Document data flows and retention

❌ **DON'T:**
- Send user data to external services without consent
- Store unnecessary personal information
- Use weak encryption algorithms
- Log sensitive user data
- Keep data longer than necessary
```

### 🛠️ **Security Tools**
